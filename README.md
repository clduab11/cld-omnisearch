## Features

### üîç Search Tools

- **Tavily Search**: Optimized for factual information with strong
  citation support. Supports domain filtering through API parameters
  (include_domains/exclude_domains).
- **Brave Search**: Privacy-focused search with good technical content
  coverage. Features native support for search operators (site:,
  -site:, filetype:, intitle:, inurl:, before:, after:, and exact
  phrases).
- **Kagi Search**: High-quality search results with minimal
  advertising influence, focused on authoritative sources. Supports
  search operators in query string (site:, -site:, filetype:,
  intitle:, inurl:, before:, after:, and exact phrases).
- **GitHub Search**: Comprehensive code search across public GitHub
  repositories with three specialized tools:
  - **Code Search**: Find code examples, function definitions, and
    files using advanced syntax (`filename:`, `path:`, `repo:`,
    `user:`, `language:`, `in:file`)
  - **Repository Search**: Discover repositories with sorting by
    stars, forks, or recent updates
  - **User Search**: Find GitHub users and organizations

### üéØ Search Operators

MCP Omnisearch provides powerful search capabilities through operators
and parameters:

#### Common Search Features

- Domain filtering: Available across all providers
  - Tavily: Through API parameters (include_domains/exclude_domains)

  indexes (Teclis, TinyGem)
- **Jina AI Grounding**: Real-time fact verification against web
  knowledge

## Flexible API Key Requirements

MCP Omnisearch is designed to work with the API keys you have
available. You don't need to have keys for all providers - the server
will automatically detect which API keys are available and only enable
those providers.

For example:

- If you only have a Tavily and Perplexity API key, only those
  providers will be available
- If you don't have a Kagi API key, Kagi-based services won't be
  available, but all other providers will work normally
- The server will log which providers are available based on the API
  keys you've configured

This flexibility makes it easy to get started with just one or two
providers and add more as needed.

## Configuration

This server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are
examples for different environments:

### Cline Configuration

Add this to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["/path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"],
			"env": {
				"TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-tavily-key",
				"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-perplexity-key",
				"KAGI_API_KEY": "your-kagi-key",
				"JINA_AI_API_KEY": "your-jina-key",
				"BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-key",
				"GITHUB_API_KEY": "your-github-key",
				"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "your-firecrawl-key",
				"FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3002"
			},
			"disabled": false,
			"autoApprove": []
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration

For WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "wsl.exe",
			"args": [
				"bash",
				"-c",
				"TAVILY_API_KEY=key1 PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=key2 KAGI_API_KEY=key3 JINA_AI_API_KEY=key4 BRAVE_API_KEY=key5 GITHUB_API_KEY=key6 FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=key7 FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002 node /path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Environment Variables

The server uses API keys for each provider. **You don't need keys for
all providers** - only the providers corresponding to your available
API keys will be activated:

- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: For Tavily Search
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: For Perplexity AI
- `KAGI_API_KEY`: For Kagi services (FastGPT, Summarizer, Enrichment)
- `JINA_AI_API_KEY`: For Jina AI services (Reader, Grounding)
- `BRAVE_API_KEY`: For Brave Search
- `GITHUB_API_KEY`: For GitHub search services (Code, Repository, User
  search)
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: For Firecrawl services (Scrape, Crawl, Map,
  Extract, Actions)
- `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL`: For self-hosted Firecrawl instances (optional,
  defaults to Firecrawl cloud service)

You can start with just one or two API keys and add more later as
needed. The server will log which providers are available on startup.

### GitHub API Key Setup

To use GitHub search features, you'll need a GitHub personal access
token with **public repository access only** for security:

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**: Navigate to
   [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

2. **Create a new token**: Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new
   token (classic)"

3. **Configure token settings**:

   - **Name**: `MCP Omnisearch - Public Search`
   - **Expiration**: Choose your preferred expiration (90 days
     recommended)
   - **Scopes**: **Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED**

     ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do not select any scopes. An empty scope token
     can only access public repositories and user profiles, which is
     exactly what we want for search functionality.

4. **Generate and copy**: Click "Generate token" and copy the token
   immediately

5. **Add to environment**: Set `GITHUB_API_KEY=your_token_here`

**Security Notes**:

- This token configuration ensures no access to private repositories
- Only public code search, repository discovery, and user profiles are
  accessible
- Rate limits: 5,000 requests/hour for code search, 10 requests/minute
  for code search specifically
- You can revoke the token anytime from GitHub settings if needed

### Self-Hosted Firecrawl Configuration

If you're running a self-hosted instance of Firecrawl, you can
configure MCP Omnisearch to use it by setting the `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL`
environment variable. This allows you to maintain complete control
over your data processing pipeline.

**Self-hosted Firecrawl setup:**

1. Follow the
   [Firecrawl self-hosting guide](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/self-host)
2. Set up your Firecrawl instance (default runs on
   `http://localhost:3002`)
3. Configure MCP Omnisearch with your self-hosted URL:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002
# or for a remote self-hosted instance:
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=https://your-firecrawl-domain.com
```

**Important notes:**

- If `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL` is not set, MCP Omnisearch will default to
  the Firecrawl cloud service
- Self-hosted instances support the same API endpoints (`/v1/scrape`,
  `/v1/crawl`, etc.)
- You'll still need a `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` even for self-hosted
  instances
- Self-hosted Firecrawl provides enhanced security and customization
  options

## Docker Deployment

MCP Omnisearch supports containerized deployment using Docker with
MCPO (Model Context Protocol Over HTTP) integration, enabling cloud
deployment and OpenAPI access.

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/spences10/mcp-omnisearch.git
cd mcp-omnisearch

# Create .env file with your API keys
echo "TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key" > .env
echo "KAGI_API_KEY=your-kagi-key" >> .env
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key" >> .env
# Add other API keys as needed
echo "GITHUB_API_KEY=your-github-key" >> .env

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Using Docker directly**:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-omnisearch .
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key \
  -e KAGI_API_KEY=your-kagi-key \
  -e PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key \
  -e GITHUB_API_KEY=your-github-key \
  --name mcp-omnisearch \
  mcp-omnisearch
```

### Container Environment Variables

# Build and tag for your registry
docker build -t your-registry/mcp-omnisearch:latest .
docker push your-registry/mcp-omnisearch:latest

# Deploy with your platform's CLI or web interface
# Configure environment variables through your platform's settings
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm run build
```

4. Run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Publishing

1. Update version in package.json
2. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

3. Publish to npm:

```bash
pnpm publish
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Keys and Access

Each provider requires its own API key and may have different access
requirements:

- **Tavily**: Requires an API key from their developer portal
- **Perplexity**: API access through their developer program
- **Kagi**: Some features limited to Business (Team) plan users
- **Jina AI**: API key required for all services
- **Brave**: API key from their developer portal
- **GitHub**: Personal access token with **no scopes selected**
  (public access only)
- **Firecrawl**: API key required from their developer portal

### Rate Limits

Each provider has its own rate limits. The server will handle rate
limit errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.
