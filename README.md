# mcp-omnisearch

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides unified access to
multiple search providers and AI tools. This server combines the
capabilities of Tavily, Perplexity, Kagi, Jina AI, and Brave to offer
comprehensive search, AI responses, content processing, and
enhancement features through a single interface.

## Flexible API Key Requirements

MCP Omnisearch is designed to work with the API keys you have
available. You don't need to have keys for all providers - the server
will automatically detect which API keys are available and only enable
those providers.

For example:

- If you only have a Tavily and Perplexity API key, only those
  providers will be available
- If you don't have a Kagi API key, Kagi-based services won't be
  available, but all other providers will work normally
- The server will log which providers are available based on the API
  keys you've configured

This flexibility makes it easy to get started with just one or two
providers and add more as needed.

## Configuration

This server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are
examples for different environments:

### Cline Configuration

Add this to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["/path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"],
			"env": {
				"TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-tavily-key",
				"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-perplexity-key",
				"KAGI_API_KEY": "your-kagi-key",
				"JINA_AI_API_KEY": "your-jina-key",
				"BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-key"
			},
			"disabled": false,
			"autoApprove": []
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration

For WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "wsl.exe",
			"args": [
				"bash",
				"-c",
				"TAVILY_API_KEY=key1 PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=key2 KAGI_API_KEY=key3 JINA_AI_API_KEY=key4 BRAVE_API_KEY=key5 node /path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Environment Variables

The server uses API keys for each provider. **You don't need keys for
all providers** - only the providers corresponding to your available
API keys will be activated:

- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: For Tavily Search
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: For Perplexity AI
- `KAGI_API_KEY`: For Kagi services (FastGPT, Summarizer, Enrichment)
- `JINA_AI_API_KEY`: For Jina AI services (Reader, Grounding)
- `BRAVE_API_KEY`: For Brave Search

You can start with just one or two API keys and add more later as
needed. The server will log which providers are available on startup.

## Troubleshooting

### API Keys and Access

Each provider requires its own API key and may have different access
requirements:

- **Tavily**: Requires an API key from their developer portal
- **Perplexity**: API access through their developer program
- **Kagi**: Some features limited to Business (Team) plan users
- **Jina AI**: API key required for all services
- **Brave**: API key from their developer portal

### Rate Limits

Each provider has its own rate limits. The server will handle rate
limit errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.
